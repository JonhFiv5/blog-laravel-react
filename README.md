# Simple Blog Built With Laravel And React

![Work in Progress](https://i.imgur.com/SH5nh4A.png)

*This website is still in development; itÂ´s a project to exercise and train my skills.*

I'm using Inertia.js to create a React front-end directly inside the Laravel repository.

    - Follow other users.
- For administrators:
    - Create high-priority posts.
    - Approve or remove posts.
    - Ban basic users.
    - View statistics for all users and posts.
